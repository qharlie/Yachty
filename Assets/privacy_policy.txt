You clipboard history is stored locally at ~/.jc_history.txt ( ~ here translates to the users home which in Windows 10 is /Users/$YOUR_USERNAME , it uses the USERPROFILE environmental variable ) and that is the only location.

Yachty does not transmit your data anywhere or connect to any remote servers, it lives only on your machine.

The three files Yachty creates are:

~/.jc_config.txt
~/.jc_history.txt
~/.jc_log.txt
