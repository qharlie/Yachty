# JumpcutW

JumpcutW is a clipboard history tool that records your clipboard history and displays it menu from the taskbar.  Selecting the item will then copy it to your current clipboard and you can paste like you normally would.

JumpcutW is a clone of the famous Jumpcut for MacOS https://snark.github.io/jumpcut/ , but not as good since selecting the menu loses focus of the original input and can't autopaste the item upon selecting it.  I hope that a global hot key would help me get around this.
