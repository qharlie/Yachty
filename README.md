# JumpcutW

JumpcutW is a clipboard history tool that records your clipboard history and displays it menu from the taskbar.  Selecting the item will then copy it to your current clipboard and you can paste like you normally would.

JumpcutW is a clone of the famous Jumpcut for MacOS https://snark.github.io/jumpcut/ , but not nearly as good ( no autopaste ).

# Ensuring JumpcutW stays visible in the Task Tray

With Windows 10 you have to tell it which icons you want visible, hit Start->Type "Taskbar Settings", Scroll Down untill you find the phrase "Select which icons appear on the taskbar" , and toggle JumpcutW.exe to ON.
